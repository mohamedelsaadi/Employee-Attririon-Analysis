‚ú® Employee Attrition Analysis with Power BI ‚ú®

I recently completed an in-depth Employee Attrition Analysis using Power BI, where I uncovered key factors contributing to employee turnover and proposed actionable insights to help organizations boost retention. Here's a quick overview of my approach, findings, and recommendations:

üìä Step-by-Step Approach:

1- Created a Fact Table to store numerical metrics and measurements.

2- Built 5 Dimension Tables containing descriptive attributes by duplicating the original dataset and selecting relevant columns.

3- Established relationships in the Power BI model view, connecting the Fact Table to the Dimension Tables using the EmployeeNumber column as the primary key.

üîç Key Insights:

1- Training & Attrition:

Employees with low training had the highest attrition rate.

Medium training also showed significant attrition, highlighting the need for comprehensive training programs.

2- Experience Level & Attrition:

Newcomers (employees with less experience) showed the highest attrition rate, followed by experienced employees, suggesting onboarding challenges and role misalignment.

3- Job Role & Income:

Sales Representatives face a 40% attrition rate with a minimum income of $1,052, while Sales Executives have a 17% attrition rate at $4,001.

4- Income Brackets & Attrition:

Low income: 29% attrition

Medium income: 12% attrition

5- Business Travel:

Employees who travel frequently face a 52% attrition rate vs. 17% for non-traveling employees.

6- Commute Distance:

Employees commuting long distances have the highest attrition at 40%.

7- Last Promotion:

Recently promoted employees had the highest attrition rate at 19%, potentially indicating post-promotion dissatisfaction.

          Recommendations for Reducing Attrition:

‚úÖ Enhance Training Programs: Invest in regular, structured training to reduce disengagement.

‚úÖ Improve Onboarding: Focus on mentorship and role clarity for newcomers.

‚úÖ Salary Adjustments:

Increase pay for Sales Representatives and low-income employees.

Align compensation with industry standards for departments like Sales & R&D.

‚úÖ Reduce Travel Frequency: Offer hybrid work and flexible options.

‚úÖ Support Commuters: Provide allowances, flexible hours, or remote work options.

‚úÖ Mentorship for Promotions: Pair newly promoted employees with mentors to ensure smoother transitions.
